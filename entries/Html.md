# HTML

HTML is a markup language that can be used to define the structure of a web page. HTML elements include

* headings
* paragraphs
* lists
* links

The most recent major version of HTML is HTML5. 

Although HTML is the backbone of the internet, snobs don't consider it a programming language.
